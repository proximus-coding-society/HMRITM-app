__<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>__

_Whether it's a simple __checkmark__ next to the name, a verbal attendence or just lots of worries whether the teacher listened my __'present ma'am'__ or not -- it's got to be done everyday -- even every lecture. Confused about the day-to-day __schedule__ of fresher's party to fest, sessionals to finals, VAPS to summer training. Or just swiping your phone gallery to find the __assignment__ posted last month in the class group._

__It's lot to keep a track of -- but not to worry. With the advancement in technology__ _(without what the heck we can think off)_ __our app will help to reduce teacher's as well as student's effort.__

* __Firebase__ for Backend
